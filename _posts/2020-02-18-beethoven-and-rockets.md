# Beethoven and Rockets

For most of 2019 I was working on one beethoven piano sonata. The first movement is one of the most popular pieces of piano music in history, nicknamed The Moonlight Sonata. The third movement is very difficult, though I knew it was mostly within reach. During that same time, I got a job at a rocket factory.

Both have been going well and now it's almost two months into the year. I can make it through most of the Moonlight sonata from memory. I bought the full Henle Urtext of all 32 Beethoven piano sonatas. I started with the first one, which is more difficult than I expected. I don't really like the way it sounds (like Hayden or Mozart) but the harmonic movement and hand spread is good practice.

I got bored and moved onto the 21st sonata, titled Waldstein. That one is dope. I'm working through the theme. It's way too technically challenging for my level but still fun to practice at a slower speed.

This year is Beethoven's 250th birthday and I'm still working at the rocket factory!
