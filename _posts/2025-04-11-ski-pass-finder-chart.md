VIBECODING IS FUN! I made a chart comparing some of the ways ski resort corporations can scam you for mountain access. For the 2025/26 season I'm gonna get an Epic Pass and an Ikon Base Pass. Also a Sierra Play Pass, which isn't on this chart but it's like the price of two window tickets so it's marginal for the whole cost. I got in like 30 days at that mountain this year so I know it very well.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">

</div>

Have fun!
