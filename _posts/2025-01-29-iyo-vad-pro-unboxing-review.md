I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the creators program for the [IYO VAD PRO](https://www.iyo.audio/vadpro). This is a product made by a company called IYO. It consists of custom silicone molds of my own ear canals, a high end headphone driver, an embedded DSP processor, an IMU and a MEMS microphone array. Watch the video for the full rundown of the unboxing, fitting and software installation.

I'm excited to integrate this device into a project I'm working on in the psychoacoustic space. Read more about that in [my source code notes](https://github.com/lazzarello/binaural-controller). I expect there will be more blog posts when that gets going this spring.
