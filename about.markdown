Hi. I'm Lee Azzarello. This is a blog. I write about technology, classical composers and art.

During the day I work in a [rocket factory](https://astra.com).

On weekends I practice classical piano.

Occasionally I make [experimental electronic music](https://bandcamp.com/lazzarello/following/artists_and_labels).

I have anarcho-communist beliefs. I try and express them through my writing without being a pundit on politics.

Code on [Github](https://github.com/lazzarello).

Shitposts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leeazzarello).

Mood boards [on are.na](https://www.are.na/lee-azzarello).
